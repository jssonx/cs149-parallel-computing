# Stanford CS149: Parallel Computing

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of resources, including syllabus, lectures, programming assignments, to facilitate a deep understanding of parallel computing systems and programming techniques.

## Course Overview

CS149 aims to impart a fundamental grasp of the principles and trade-offs in modern parallel computing system design. It also focuses on teaching parallel programming skills necessary to effectively leverage these systems. An integral part of the course is understanding machine performance characteristics, hence both parallel hardware and software design are covered.

### Instructor

The course is taught by Professor [Kayvon Fatahalian](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~kayvonf/), who previously taught a similar course at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), 15-418.

### Course Resources

- **Syllabus & Lectures:** For a detailed course outline, visit the [Stanford CS149 website](http://cs149.stanford.edu/fall20/). The CMU version of the course, 15-418, offers a more extensive coverage and can be accessed [here](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~418/).

- **Programming Assignments:** This course includes five programming assignments. My implementations are available at the following links:
